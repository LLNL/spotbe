# SPOT Back-End

This is the back-end code to SPOT, a web-based visualization tool for performance data.  

You likely don't want to check out this repo directly, unless you're making changes to SPOT.
It's instead recommended to get the spot_container and let it check out this repo as a submodule.
To build SPOT into a container see:
